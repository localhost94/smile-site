| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | SDG RELEVANCE | A description that links the digital solution to the SDG list of targets and indicators |  |  |  |  | Evidence is required only for the the most relevant SDGs to the solution. We need to provide information for each SDG the solution may be relevant to.I think SMILE satisfies the following SDG (Virgi can be involved in this activity)SDG3:Good Health and well beingSDG 5: Gender equalitySDG 10: Reduced Inequality |
| 2 | OPEN LICENSING | A public link that explicitly mentions an approved open license |  |  |  |  | Document highlighting the technology stack. Format for documentation is available in the link belowhttps://opensource.org/licenses |
| 3 | CLEAR OWNERSHIP | Link(s) to the copyright, trademarks, or publicly available ownership documentation for the digital solution. Examples include a webpage that clearly defines who owns the digital solution or Terms of Service that indicate ownership |  |  |  |  | SMILE Case study on UNDP Indonesia/Digita Hub website (public websites)which clearly states joint ownership by MOH and UNDP Indonesia |
| 4 | PLATFORM INDEPENDENCE | Applicants must provide a description of how open-source components are independent and/or list the open alternatives for any closed component(s). Applications should be able to demonstrate that closed components can be replaced with open alternatives with minimal configuration changes and without requiring a major overhaul of the entire solution. |  |  |  |  | Technical documentation (involve BADR and Irina for this activity) |
| 5 | DOCUMENTATION | A detailed description of how the solution is documented as well as link(s) to all relevant documents |  |  |  |  | Our confluence page will work here. Kindly ensure the recenr functional specs for SMILE 5.O including waste management is available on confluence |
| 6 | MECHANISM FOR EXTRACTING DATA | If Personally Identifiable information is stored then link(s) to the privacy policy, terms of service, or other relevant legal documentation must be provided |  |  |  |  | Since SMILE does not have beneficary module then this does not apply to us.
